Running
=======

Open two terminals.

In one terminal type:

./server <PORT NUMBER>

In the other terminal type:

./client <SERVER IP> <PORT NUMBER>

Make sure that the port numbers for
client and server match.

The server will report the connection,
the data sent to the client, and any
status changes or errors.

Example

Note, the full output will be shown
after both server and client have been
deployed.

Server terminal:

./server 1234
Port  = 1234
